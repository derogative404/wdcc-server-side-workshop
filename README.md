# WDCC &ndash; Node.js and Express Workshop

This workshop is designed to give a basic introduction into Node.js and Express.

It will also cover some basic details about how server-side projects can be structured.

The slides used in the presentation are available here: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12AS2DqsVHlcvy1oDWy45Ed984BgrF0Rtf8Xi0mZWxQ0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12AS2DqsVHlcvy1oDWy45Ed984BgrF0Rtf8Xi0mZWxQ0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Obtaining the code

You should fork and clone this repository and open it with an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Because this project contains server-side Node.js and Express code, you should make sure to setup node.js properly based on the instructions below.

**Note:** Whenever this lab mentions opening a "terminal window", any terminal *should* work. However, the work has only been tested using `git bash`.

**Note 2:** Remember to run `npm install` for each webapp (except Exercise One), to make sure all necessary packages (including Express) are installed.

## Exercise Zero &ndash; Installing node.js

To complete this and future labs and assignments, you'll need to install **node.js** onto your development machine. To do this, browse to the [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/), and follow the instructions. Get the latest **LTS** version.

**Note:** When installing, if the installer asks you to add something to your `PATH`, then you should allow this.

Once the install is complete, you can verify it by opening a terminal and typing the following commands:

```
npm --version
node --version
```

These should both print a version number to the console, and not give any errors. Be sure to seek help from a staff member if you believe you've installed correctly but are getting errors.

## Exercise One &ndash; The simplest server&trade;

In this exercise, we will examine and run the simplest possible node.js web server, and make a small modification to it.

Begin by examining `exercise-01.js`, located within the [`exercise-01`](./exercise-01) folder. The code creates a simple HTTP server, which will call a function whenever it receives a request. That function will simply return a text message to the client.

To run the app, open a terminal window **in the exercise-01 folder**. Then, execute the following command:

```
node exercise-01.js
```

This command won't print any output to the terminal for this simple program - but you can tell it's running as you won't get the prompt allowing you to enter more console commands.

Once the server is running, open a browser window and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed.

Once you've verified this, modify `exercise-01.js` so that a different message of your choice will be sent back to the client instead.

- If you'd like more of a challenge, try sending JSON back rather than a simple text message.

  **Hint:** The content type for JSON is `application/json`. And, remember the `JSON.stringify()` function.

Once you've made your modification, we'll need to restart the server, or you won't be able to see the changes you've made. Go back to the terminal window running your server, and stop it by using `Ctrl+C`. You should see that you get your prompt back, allowing you to type more terminal commands.

Then, rerun `node exercise-01.js`. Finally, refresh / reload [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser. You should see the change you made.

**Note:** If you've followed the steps above correctly, and don't see your changes (or any error messages indicating you made a mistake), you may have encountered a browser *caching* issue. To clear your browser's cache on Chrome or Edge,

## Exercise Two &ndash; The simplest Express webapp&trade;

In this exercise, we will examine and run a simple *Express* web server, and make some small modifications to it.

Begin by examining the contents of `exercise-02.js`, located in the [`exercise-02`](./exercise-02) folder. This is a simple Express webapp, which makes all files in the "public" folder available for browsing by clients. It also will display "Hello World!" to clients when they browse to the root path *"`/`"* (e.g. [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)).

This webapp has a dependency on the `express` package, which is *not* available by default. It must be downloaded and installed into your project using the Node Package Manager (`npm`).

If you were creating your project from scratch, you would first need to create a `package.json` file using the `npm init` command (see lecture notes for details). You would then install the `express` package using the following command:

```sh
npm install express --save
```

In *this* case however (and as will be the case with most lab exercises), the `package.json` file has already been provided for you, and configured with the `express` dependency (you can examine the file in a text editor to see how this looks). You must, however, still download the dependencies - this is because it is extremely bad practice for the packages (`node_modules`) folder to be committed to a repository.

Luckily, the provided `package.json` file contains all the information necessary to recreate the `node_modules` folder. Simply open a terminal window in the `exercise-02` folder and run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

This command will examine `package.json`, and download and install all required dependencies.

Once dependencies are installed, we can run our webapp just as we did for Exercise One:

```sh
node exercise-02.js
```

This time, when the command is run, you should see a message notifying you that the app has started. Once you see this, browse to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). You should see "Hello World!" displayed.

You should also be able to browse to [http://localhost:3000/mypage.html](http://localhost:3000/mypage.html), as `mypage.html` is located within the `public` folder, and therefore accessible.

Browsing to any other URL (e.g. [http://localhost:3000/notexist](http://localhost:3000/notexist)) should result in an error such as `cannot GET /notexist` being displayed in the browser. This is because there is no *route handler* defined for that URL, and also no matching file in the `public` folder.

Other than running the command `node exercise-02.js`, we should also be able to run the `start` *npm* command, by running the following command:

```sh
npm run start
```

This command will also cause our server to be started. This is because, in our `package.json` file, we have configured the `start` command as you can see on line `6`. In VS Code, you may also see an *"NPM SCRIPTS"* option near the bottom-left of the window, and the start command for each of the lab exercises should be visible there.

Once you've checked that everything works as expected, perform the following tasks to modify the webapp (remembering to restart the server to test each change):

1. Modify the existing route handler so a different message, of your choice, is sent to the client instead of "Hello World!".
2. Find an image of your choice, and add it to the `public/images` folder (you may need to create this folder). Verify that you can successfully browse to your image. In addition, modify `mypage.html` to include your image and make sure that it displays correctly.
3. Add an additional route handler to `exercise-02.js`. Whenever the user browses to `/about`, the message "I am awesome!" should be sent back.
4. Add a new HTML file called `index.html` to the `public` folder (its contents can be anything you like). Now, browse to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). What is displayed, and why? Comment your answer here:

```
Hello Sebastian! 
Since this is working on the root path. 
I am awesome is on the route with the about page.
```

## Exercise Three &ndash; Serving up JSON

Using Express, it is trivial to send JSON data to clients - we simply use the *response* object's `json()` method from within our route handler. For example:

```js
app.get("/gimmeJSON", function (req, res) {
    const person = {
        name: "Walter White",
        address: "308 Negra Arroyo Lane"
    };

    res.json(person);
});
```

In this exercise, we will examine how we can use this functionality to help link our front-end code to our back-end code (using `fetch()` on the frontend).

To begin, examine `exercise-03.js`, within the [`exercise-03`](./exercise-03) folder. In particular, focus on the `/gimmeJSON` route handler. In addition, examine the client-side files `index.html` and `js/exercise-03-client.js` (located in the `public` folder). You'll see how we can use `fetch()`, within our client-side JavaScript, to access results returned by our server-side JavaScript.

Run the webapp (remembering to `npm install` first), and verify that Walter White's details show up in your browser window when browsing to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Then, modify the webapp as follows:

1. Modify the existing route handler so it returns the details of a different person of your choice.
2. As well as a name and address, give the person some additional info of your choice, such as a phone number. Then, modify `index.html` and `exercise-03-client.js` so the additional info is displayed.
3. Add an additional route handler to the webapp. Whenever a client makes a GET request to `/randomNumber`, a random *integer* (i.e. whole number) between `0` and `100` should be generated. The handler should return JSON of the following form to the client:

   ```js
   const json = {
       number: RND_NUM
   };
   ```

   where `RND_NUM` is the random number you generated. **Hint:** See [this page](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-math-random-function/) for more info on random numbers in JavaScript. Or investigate the [`uuid` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid).

   Once you've created your handler, verify that it works by browsing to [http://localhost:3000/randomNumber](http://localhost:3000/randomNumber). A different random number should be returned each time.
4. Add code to `exercise-03-client.js` so that when the `generate-random` `<button>` is clicked, a `fetch()` call is made to your new route handler. When the result is retrieved, convert it to json, and display the `number` that's returned in the `random-number` `<span>`. Again, make sure to test your functionality.

## Exercise Four &ndash; Sending data to the server

There are several ways in which clients can send data to the server. We will investigate some of them in this exercise.

To begin, examine the `exercise-04.js` webapp, and associated `index.html` and `exercise-04-client.js` client files. See how the client sends data to the server in three ways:

1. Via a `fetch()` in `exercise-04-client.js`, with the query string `name=Andrew`.
2. Via the first `<form>` in `index.html`, with `method=GET`.
3. Via the second `<form>` in `index.html`, with `method=POST`.

Also note the third `<form>`, which contains multiple `<input>`s with the same `name`.

Run the webapp, examine the four route handlers defined in `exercise-04.js`, and make sure you understand how the client is sending data in each case. Then, make the following modifications:

1. Modify the first `<form>` by adding another `<input>` (you can ask the user for any info you like). Modify the corresponding route handler such that your new input is read by the server, and its value is returned in the JSON back to the client.
2. Repeat step 1, but for the second `<form>`. Try to add a different kind of `<input>` this time.
3. Change the final `<form>` (the one with the checkboxes) to use `method=POST` instead of `method=GET`. Modify the corresponding route handler such that the form submission will still be accepted by the server.
4. Modify the `fetch()` in `exercise-04-client.js`, to send an additional parameter other than just `name`. For example, you could send a `title` (whose values might be "Mr", "Mrs", "Ms", "Dr", etc). Modify the corresponding route handler such that your new parameter is also used in the generated greeting (using the `title` example, the new greeting might be "Hello, Dr. Andrew!", for example).

   **Hint:** Any number of query parameters can be chained together using `&`. For example: `.../getGreeting?name=Andrew&title=Mr`.

## Exercise Five &ndash; Revisiting the questionnaire

For this exercise, you have been provided with a form that looks like this:

![](./spec/ex05-screenshot.png)

You'll find a model solution to this exercise in the [`exercise-05/public`](./exercise-05/public) folder (`form.html`), except that the form's `action` and `method` have been removed.

At the marked location within `exercise-05.js`, add a route handler (the path can be anything you like, but try and have it make sense). When the user browses to [http://localhost:3000/form.html](http://localhost:3000/form.html), then submits the form with a `GET` request, your route handler should be called, read all the submitted values, and send them back to the client as JSON - similarly to the examples in Exercise Four.

Write your code so that it checks if all fields in the form contained values and weren't just empty strings `""` . If some inputs from the form were empty, instead of sending the JSON representation of the form data back, you should send a message back to the client that some inputs were empty.

Once you've done this, add an appropriate `action` and `method` to the `<form>` in `form.html`, then run and test your server. Make sure all data is read in as expected.

Next, extend your webapp such that the form can be submitted via `POST` as well as `GET`. You can achieve this by adding a new route handler to the same path, but a different method. When adding the new handler, try to *reuse as much code as possible* - the vast majority of your code should **not** need to be duplicated!

Once you're done, test your code by submitting the form as-is (to test that you didn't break existing functionality), *then* by changing the form's `method` to `POST`, and verifying that everything works as intended.

## Exercise Six - Creating an API

#### Familiarising yourself with the code:

In this exercise, you have been provided with a very basic mock database that consists of two arrays of JavaScript objects. Your task will be to create a well designed API that could provide a client like a web browser access to this data. For this task, you will not need to create the user interface that would run on the client. You should use a tool like Postman to test your API. You may also want to make some basic HTML forms to test the ability to generate requests from the web browser if you wish, but this is option as you can simulate form submission through a tool like Postman.

Familiarise yourself with the code included in exercise-06 before you start the tasks below.

The mock data that you have been given consists of:

- An array of film objects that have the following properties:
  - id
  - filmTitle
  - releaseYear
  - directorId
  - length
- An array of director object that have the following properties:
  - id
  - firstName
  - lastName
  - age
  - gender
  - country

You have also been provided with a couple of example data access functions that use the .filter method to get films based on specific parameters; these are:

- getFIlmsWithinYears
- getFIlmsByDirectorId

You will need to write some more functions like these for this task.

Note: the mock data has been included within the main file for the sake of convenience and also so you can familiarise yourself with the general idea of arrays of JavaScript objects. It is important to remember that in a more complex application, the data would be stored within a real database and the functions that access data would generally be separated into separate modules.

You have also been provide with a route handler function that can handle a GET request to the path `/test` . This route handler function has been provided as a demonstration of the general idea of how you can access data through the provided functions using query parameters from the request.

There is also one very basic html form within the `public` directory that has the necessary inputs to generate a request to the `/test` route handler. 

### Tasks:

#### Requirements:

You will be required to create an API that allows clients to retrieve data from the API based on any property of the films or directors. The API should always send data in responses as JSON so that it would be compatible with any range of modern UI/UX frameworks like React that render UI components based on JSON data received from the server.

You will probably not have time to implement all of the code for the full API in the timeframe of the workshop; however, you should read the full requirements and design how you would implement the API to have well organised methods, paths and parameters. The point of having a large number of requirements outlined in the task, is to get you to think about how you would structure the server-side code for a larger API that provides access to a lot of data through the use of consistent conventions. It is suggested that you look at some open APIs online like[ https://pokeapi.co/ ](https://pokeapi.co/)as examples.

You may customise some of the requirements yourself; however, these are the minimal requirements that would be provided by the API when complete:

- Get a film by id
- Get films by title
- Get films by one specific release year
- Get films by inputting the range of release years (minimum & maximum)
- Get films by director id
- Get films by maximum length
- Get films by minimum length
- Get films by a range of lengths (minimum & maximum)
- Add a film to the data by specifying all required properties for a film object
- Delete a film from the data based on a specific id
- Get director by id
  - As an added challenge you should try to get all films by the director and include the array of film objects by that director as an extra property in the data about the director
- Get director/s by first name
- Get director/s by last name
- Get directors within an age range
- Get directors by gender
- Get directors by country
- Add a director to the data by specifying all required properties for a director object
- Delete a director from the data based on a specific id

#### Planning and designing your API:

For this step, you will develop a basic plan for how the API should be structured. 

It is suggested that you design your API around REST principles and best practices for use of methods, parameters, path naming conventions etc.

You should research some information related to how to design an API. Search queries like "REST API naming conventions and best practices" or "Best practices for API design" should lead you to some helpful information. There are also some standardised ways of documenting APIs.

You should plan out a basic idea of how you will make all data available through the consistent use of methods, paths and parameters in requests. 

For this step, you do not need to formally write out the plan for every route handler; however, you should have some idea how you will structure your code before moving onto the next step whether it is in your head or written down somewhere.

### Writing and testing your server-side functionality route handler functions:

After you have developed a plan of how you would like to structure your code, you should create the server-side functionality.

You should follow these steps:

- It is suggested that you start by renaming the "/test" route handler to have an appropriate path that fits with your API design
- Write your route handler functions and associated data access functions one at a time and test them with Postman as you go
- Work through implementing each of the requirements step-by-step making sure to test a range of valid expected inputs for each route handler you create
- If you are not sure about how to create all of the required code, start with something simple like the route handler that will get films by director id; the data access function for getting films by director id has been provided for you
- Work through as many of the requirements as you can in the time available, but you do not need to finish all of them if you run out of time

### Refactoring with modules and routers

After you have developed some of your route handler functions, you should move on to refactoring your code to use modules and routers.

- Move all of the route handler functions related to film data into an apporpriately named directory and configure all files necessary so that they run from a dedicated router file
- Move all of the route handler functions related to director data into an apporpriately named directory and configure all files necessary so that they run from a dedicated router file
- Move all of film and director data and the functions that access film and director data into a separate module/s and then export the functions from the module/s so that they can be used where necessary

### Suggested extension exercises:

- Try to add the functionality for your API to be able to respond appropriately to invalid inputs to specific URL paths; for example, if an invalid value is given as a parameter for something like an id, age or year then the server should respond appropriately whenever possible; you should investigate things like error and exception handling and HTTP status codes
  - Note: this is a very open ended task as error handling, exceptions and status codes can get quite complex
- Investigate how to move the "mock database" into MongoDB and associated technologies like MongoDB Atlas to have the film and director data in a proper database; this would likely require quite a bit of time to study MongoDB if you aren't already familiar with it, so it is probably not possible within the timeframe of the workshop unless you have moved very quickly through the API creation; this exercise is suggested extension for those who might have a lot of prior experience with Node.js and Express
  - It is suggested that you look up resources online that have information related to MongoDB
- Build some sort of front-end that can connect with your API and allow a user to access all information from the API; this could be built in React if you are familiar with React
